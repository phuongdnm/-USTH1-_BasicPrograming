# [USTH-First year] Basic Programing Labworks
The C programming language is one of the most popular programming languages. Despite being fairly old programming language, it is widely used for system and application software. because of its efficiency and control.

This course is intended for beginners who do not have any prior knowledge or have very little knowledge of computer programming. All basic features of C programming language are included in detail such as basic syntax, data types, operators, control flow, functions, arrays, pointers, union, structure, and the standard c library.

In this course, you will not only learn the C programming language, but you also improve your computational skills beneficial to your major field of study.

## How to use
There are **2 ways** you can run C files in your computer:  
* Using IDE ( Code::Blocks/ Dev-C++)

```

### Sofware installation

##### Using IDE: 
Download and install Code::Blocks or Def-C++:
* [Code::Blocks](https://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/17.12/Windows/codeblocks-17.12mingw-setup.exe/download)
* [Def-C++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/)
#### Using cmd/powershell:
It's more complicated than the previous method, but you will look more professional.

> The hardes part of programing is setting up the environment.  

## Note
- [X] I highly recommend you to do the problems first.  
- [X] You should give it a try. I used to be in the same situation when I learned basic C.
